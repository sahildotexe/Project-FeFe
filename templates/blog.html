        <p>
          Finding the best book blogs to follow is becoming more and more popular and while books will always be my go-to, when it comes to my reading material of choice, I also love spending a lazy Saturday morning in bed with the sun streaming through my window catching up on the latest posts from some of my favourite book bloggers.

        <h4>New York City | Layout, People, Economy, Culture, & History</h4>
        <p>
          What is it like to live in New York City? Currently, I am living in New York while everyone is being quarantined, so I shall tell you what itâ€™s like to live in New York during this pandemic. You see, NY is a very populated place, meaning your chances of contracting COVID-19 is much higher than most sites.
